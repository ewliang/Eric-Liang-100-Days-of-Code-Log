### R1D1 8/6/18
**Progress**: I've started to setup more of the Twitter Clone project's UI layout and setting up some components and importing it into other parts of the website. I've also refactored some HTML layouts, and added some styling to the existing components.
**Thoughts**: I might do a off-branding clone where I use a off-black/white theme over the Twitter's default blue theme. I might also redesign and redevelop the entire clone to make up for the lack of full functionality of the Twitter site since this is supposed to be a "basic" Twitter clone site. The goal is to really just for me to practice my full stack development capabilities.

I hope I'm doing this right in terms of the 100DaysOfCode challenge...

Edit: Started on Mortgage Calculator Project setup during night time.

### R1D2 8/7/18
**Progress**: I started a different project I had on my list which is building a simple Mortgage Repayment Calculator using HTML, CSS, and plain old Javascript. The main focus of this was for me to practice my Web Design UI skills as well as to experiment with different color palettes. Another reason for this simple project is because I wanted to practice some Javascript too. I managed to finish it in a day. I did originally have a pre-made design in Photoshop, but I redesigned it with the new color palette and it looks amazing (compared to the old one that is)!

**Thoughts**: A successful trial!
