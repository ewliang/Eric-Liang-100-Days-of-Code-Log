# 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Eric Liang
The log of my #100DaysOfCode.

Started on Monday August 6, 2018 California PST.

## Log
e.g. R1D1 means Round 1 Day 1, etc.

### R1D1 8/6/18
**Progress**: I've started to setup more of the Twitter Clone project's UI layout and setting up some components and importing it into other parts of the website. I've also refactored some HTML layouts, and added some styling to the existing components.
**Thoughts**: I might do a off-branding clone where I use a off-black/white theme over the Twitter's default blue theme. I might also redesign and redevelop the entire clone to make up for the lack of full functionality of the Twitter site since this is supposed to be a "basic" Twitter clone site. The goal is to really just for me to practice my full stack development capabilities.

I hope I'm doing this right in terms of the 100DaysOfCode challenge...

Edit: Started on Mortgage Calculator Project setup during night time.

### R1D2 8/7/18
**Progress**: I started a different project I had on my list which is building a simple Mortgage Repayment Calculator using HTML, CSS, and plain old Javascript. The main focus of this was for me to practice my Web Design UI skills as well as to experiment with different color palettes. Another reason for this simple project is because I wanted to practice some Javascript too. I managed to finish it in a day. I did originally have a pre-made design in Photoshop, but I redesigned it with the new color palette and it looks amazing (compared to the old one that is)!

Minor code updates for the Twitter Clone webapp on the backend such as adding CRUD routes, initialized basic function skeleton, created a User Model, etc. Still needs work though for it to run properly.

**Thoughts**: A successful trial!

### R1D3 8/8/18
**Progress**:
- Updated personal website navlinks for consistency with framework. Still need to figure out why Bootstrap 4 menu doesn't collapse properly on mobile despite it being the same as the documentation...
- Updated personal website "About" page's "Accomplishments" section by changing it from a custom div layout to a table layout.
- Updated from Bootstrap 4.0.0 to 4.1.3
- Added data-toggle and data-target properties to navlinks so it collapses menu on page switch.

**Thoughts**: I'm very tempted to drop either the Twitter Clone project or the Blog project since they're very similar in terms of their underlying concepts. I am thinking of replacing it with a eCommerce store project I've been working on and making that open source. Hmm...

### R1D4 8/9/18
**Progress**: 
- Minor updates to the Twitter Clone project (such as more module installations, added some minor code changes to backend, changed color from Twitter blue to black.
- Created Dockerfile for Goal Striver website refactorization blog module.
- Refactored Admin Dashboard files into new frontend client framework.
- Created more components for Twitter Clone and initialized page to show public user profile with tweets made by user.
- Created project for SellMyEbook powered by StripeJS website

**Thoughts**: This is going to be one long project... I also decided to drop the project about website redesign for 100DaysOfCode (fan mockup) and change the Weather Website Webapp practice project into a Android App (most likely going to happen) using Kotlin or Java - still debating.

### R1D5 8/10/18
**Progress**
- Focused on Goal Striver webapp development.
- Created Login Form
- Made model files for backend.
- Minor code updates.

**Thoughts**: Not too much progress. Have to plan this extra carefully.

### R1D6 8/11/18
**Progress**
- Created basic webpage using StripeJS payments.
- Worked on creating components and other login form elements for GS Dashboard.
- Worked on Pensieri project with minor code updates involving templates and communication with server.

### R1D7 8/12/18
**Progress**
- I focused mainly on making changes and small improvements to my personal website after receiving feedback from yesterday's Reddit suggestions from Showoff Saturday on the /r/webdev forum.

### R1D8 8/14/18
**Progress**
- Started converting PSD to HTML design for freelance client's website gig. I was playing around with Parallax. I also might consider a fixed background image design with vertical scroll approach. Not sure yet though.

**Thoughts**
- I took a break yesterday from coding. I wanted to brainstorm on some more useful ideas and approach towards the next major update to my personal website.

### R1D9 8/15/18
**Progress**
- Continued working on coding my freelance client's website. Experimenting with a 1 page section style. Also started converting it to a Wordpress theme to hopefully be a little bit more productive on that end. At first it seemed easy, but the design challenge is beginning to become a major challenge. Hmm...

### R1D10 8/16/18
**Progress**
- I decided to go with a hybrid design solution for my freelance client's website. I originally had 2 concepts that I came up with. One was a normal multisection site, and another was a fixed single screen background with no scroll. I decided to keep the fixed background approach and used a transparent scrollable body overlay solution as it solves any problems should there be any entries that exceed the room capable within a page. This was going to be a Wordpress theme after all. I mostly worked on fixing some javascript, removing some javascript, and modifying some HTML/CSS while I was at it. I was also able to remove the infinite scroll issue due to a parallax image that failed to disappear properly.

### R1D11 8/17/18
**Progress**
- Converted all the HTML/CSS/JS into Wordpress theme template files. Cleaned up some styles and made some minor/semi-major design changes to certain parts of the site. Also learned how to make custom post types in Wordpress. It was so easy!

### R1D12 8/18/18
**Progress**
- Made minor small detail update to my personal website blog's theme.
- Worked on adding Theme Customizer for Wordpress theme.

### R1D13 8/19/18
**Progress**
- Removed placeholder text from client's Wordpress theme website. Uploaded theme to website.
- Attempted to make a simple auth website in Nuxt using nuxtjs/auth library. 

### R1D14 8/20/18
**Progress**
- Created a pure CSS full screen navigation menu. I plan to use this to replace my personal website's navigation bar since it seems to be broken.

### R1D15 8/21/18
**Progress**
- Made passport based backend for API authentication login via Node.js. Oh yeah, this is a JWT stateless version. I have experience making basic stateful auths in the past.

### R1D16 8/22/18
**Progress**
- Made protected routes and minor adjustments to backend authentication API. Tested it against some scenarios, and it works the way it's supposed to! Time to jump onto the frontend...
- Added signup route controller to backend auth API. Has some minor errors, but it does register users to the database. 

### R1D17 8/23/18
**Progress**
- Refactored some frontend code. Trying to refresh my memory on Vuex and still figuring out how to best approach Nuxt.js authentication via JWTs.

### R1D18 8/24/18
**Progress**
- Worked on trying to get Client's Wordpress theme to show custom post types' page title properly. I managed to get it to work after changing the music page template into a archive-music.php. Then I used the get_post_type or w/e function to grab the id of the post types and grabbed the title located in the functions for that type and outputted it to the "page" title. It works!

### R1D19 8/25/18
**Progress**
- Added formspree to my personal website's contact form. Works like a charm!
