# Eric Liang 100 Days of Code Log
Eric Liang's Official 100DaysOfCode Log. This repository contains all of the 100DaysOfCode challenge rounds I've ever done.
Assuming I understand the GitHub Log, I believe each "round" means each set of 100 Days. So if I do my first 100 Days of Code Challenge for the first time ever, it should be considered as "Round 1".

Some projects will be public source code which can be found on my repository [https://github.com/ewliang](https://github.com/ewliang) while others are private projects which I am not going to release and will be kept in a private repository on my Bitbucket account.

## Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge
End Date: Day 100 12/4/18 6:14 PM PST
